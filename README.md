# Budget Tracker

This is a basic budget tracking application.  You enter a transaction name, amount and click whether to add/subtract the amount from your balance.  It also displays a basic line graph to visualize your money over time.

It also has offline functionality.  You can continue using the app even with no internet connection.  All offline transactions will be uploaded as soon as you are back online.

This is built using MongoDB, Express and Node.
